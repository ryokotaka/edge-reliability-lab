# Inference Quantization Experiment

## Scope

This is a lightweight anomaly scoring experiment, not a neural network benchmark.
The goal is to add an inference stage to the reliability pipeline and compare
float-like scoring against quantized-like scoring before moving to Raspberry Pi.

## Method

1. Load `data/sample.csv`.
2. Use normal `ok` rows for calibration.
3. Treat `status = noisy` as the ground-truth anomaly label.
4. Score non-missing rows with a float-like z-score scorer.
5. Score the same rows with a quantized-like integer scorer.
6. Compare detection quality, p95 inference latency, and model state size.

## State-size estimate

The code currently reports 48 bytes for the float-like scorer and 6 bytes for the
quantized-like scorer. The latter assumes one byte per mean and standard deviation,
but the implementation stores Python integers without an int8 range check. On the
default sample, the scaled means are 254, 546, and 10,100, so that assumption does not
hold. Treat the 6-byte output as an invalid size estimate, not a measured reduction.
The detection results below are unaffected by this accounting issue.

## Result

| Metric | Float-like scoring | Quantized-like scoring |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| evaluated samples | 1738 | 1738 |
| true anomalies | 13 | 13 |
| predicted anomalies | 12 | 12 |
| true positives | 12 | 12 |
| false positives | 0 | 0 |
| false negatives | 1 | 1 |
| precision | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| recall | 0.9231 | 0.9231 |
| F1 | 0.9600 | 0.9600 |
| average inference latency | ~0.001 ms | ~0.001 ms |
| p95 inference latency | ~0.002 ms | ~0.001 ms |
| reported state estimate | 48 bytes | 6 bytes (invalid; see above) |

## Interpretation

Rounding the scorer's parameters preserved detection quality on this synthetic
sample. A storage-size comparison needs a defined encoding and range checks first.
The latency numbers are too small and Python-dependent to use as hardware evidence.
The follow-up v7 experiment adds a standard-library tiny learned model; hardware CPU, memory, and wall-clock latency should still wait for Raspberry Pi
measurements.
